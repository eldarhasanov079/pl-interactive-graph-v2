# An Interactive Tool for Randomized Autogradable Graph Assessments

## Overview  
This project introduces an **interactive graph-based assessment tool** designed for online learning platforms. It allows students to dynamically interact with graph models by clicking on nodes and edges to simulate different algorithms. The tool supports a range of graph-based problems, from **basic traversals (BFS, DFS)** to **advanced algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Kruskalâ€™s, Hypercube processing)**.

ðŸ“¢ **Presented at SIGCSE 2025 Technical Symposium in Pittsburgh, PA.**

## Features  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Interactive Graph Manipulation** â€“ Click nodes/edges to simulate different algorithms.  
- ðŸ”„ **Randomized Graph Generation** â€“ Provides unique problem instances per student.  
- ðŸ“Š **Autogradable Submissions** â€“ Automatically evaluates student responses.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Analytics** â€“ Tracks **scores, completion times, and error patterns**.  
- ðŸ’¡ **Usable in Multiple CS Courses** â€“ Supports **introductory to advanced** graph algorithms.  

## Research Goals  
The tool aims to assess and improve student learning by measuring:  
1. **Accuracy** â€“ How well students apply graph algorithms.  
2. **Completion Time** â€“ Efficiency in problem-solving.  
3. **Student Satisfaction** â€“ Engagement with interactive assessments.  
4. **Error Patterns** â€“ Analyzing common misconceptions.
